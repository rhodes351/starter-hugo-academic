I'm an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Purdue University. My research focuses on the causes and consequences of economic inequality and financial insecurity for individuals, families, and communities. Much of my work brings a political economy, demographic, and/or spatial lens to questions related to inequality, poverty and mobility. I'm especially interested in how inequalities accumulate over the life course and across different market contexts, as well as the potential for institutions and social policies to ameliorate inequalities and hardships. You can learn more about some of my recent and ongoing research projects below.

Prior to arriving at Purdue, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Wisconsin's Institute for Research on Poverty. I received my PhD from Ohio State University and my BA degrees from Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
