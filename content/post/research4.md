Many older Americans partially self-insure against the risks of older age by accumulating assets, the most significant for many being home equity. A series of projects co-authored with Stephanie Moulton, Donald Haurin, CÃ¤zilia Loibl, and colleagues investigate how housing wealth and mortgage debt influence the health and well-being of older adult homeowners. We find that access to credit in the form of mortgage borrowing is a key mechanism linking housing wealth to economic security and better health. Papers from this have been published in [Social Science & Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115437) and [The Journals of Gerontology Series B](https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbae066).
