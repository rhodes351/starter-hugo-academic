The U.S. debt collection industry has grown in tandem with rising household indebtedness. Prior research on debt and mental health mainly treats debt as a resource and liability, rather than a power relationship between creditors and debtors. In a forthcoming paper in _Journal of Health and Social Behavior_, Rachel Dwyer, Jason Houle, and I examine the mental health consequences of debt collection pressure using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1997 Cohort. Drawing on health power resources theory, we posit debt collection pressure as a relational stressor that undermines well-being through negative interactions with debt collectors, financial strain, role strain, and stigma.
